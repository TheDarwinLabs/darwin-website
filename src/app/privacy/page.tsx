          statistical data and does not include personal information, but we may

        </p>
        <p>
          • Cookies: A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your
          computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the
          appropriate settings on your browser. However, if you select this
          setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Websites.
          Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse
          cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to
          our Websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Performance and Analytics Cookies: These cookies allow us to count
          visits and traffic sources, through various third parties, so we can
          measure and improve the performance of our Websites. These enable us
          to collect information about how you use our Websites or read our
          publications, for instance which pages are viewed by visitors most
          frequently and how users interact with each of our Websites. This
          information is used to compile reports to improve the respective site,
          including reports on the number of visitors to the Websites, where the
          visitors are located, marketing and referrals, and what pages the
          users visit on our Websites. All information these cookies collect is
          aggregated and is not associated with an identifiable individual. If
          you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have visited
          our Websites and will not be able to monitor site performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Web Beacons: Pages of our Websites and our emails may contain small
          electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs,
          pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to
          count users who have visited those pages or [opened an email] and for
          other related website statistics (for example, recording the
          popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server
          integrity).
        </p>
        <p>
          • Pixel Tags: Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique
          identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track
          online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are
          stored on a computer’s hard drive or web browser, pixel tags are
          embedded invisibly in web pages. Pixel tags are often used in
          combination with cookies, to trigger the placing of cookies, and/or to
          transmit information to us or our vendors or partners. This enables
          two websites to share information. The resulting connection can
          include information such as a device’s IP address, the time a person
          viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with a browser or device,
          the type of browser being used, and the URL of the web page from which
          the pixel was viewed. Pixel tags also allow us to send email messages
          in a format that users can read, tell us whether emails have been
          opened, and help to ensure we are sending only messages that may be of
          interest to our consumers.

          control the way in which your devices permit the use of cookies, web

          If you so choose, you may block or delete our cookies from your
