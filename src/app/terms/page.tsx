          These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be

        <p>
          If any provision of the Terms is deemed invalid by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not

          continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to
          assert any right or provision under the Terms shall not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision.
